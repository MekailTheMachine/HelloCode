/* JS is a high-level and interpreted language, typically used to add interactivity and dynamic behaviour to websites. 

JavaScript is also a dynamically typed language, allowing for more flexibility, as variables can be assigned values of different types without 
requiring explicit type declarations.
However, dynamic typing can also lead to errors and make it more difficult to reason about code.
To mitigate this, JavaScript has added features such as TypeScript, which is a statically typed superset of JavaScript

Below is Hello Js, in JavaScript */


console.log("Hello, JS!");
